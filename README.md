## Overview

An interactive program built in [Processing](https://processing.org/) that allows users to build custom mazes and test them using altered [Depth-First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) and [Breadth-First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) search techniques. These search algorithms that are utilized during the maze visualization are based upon their respective functionality within the application of binary trees and are altered to function within my program.

## Usage

In order to run my program, you will need to download the [Processing](https://processing.org/) software. Once you have it downloaded, download all the proper files and folders and then open the main sketch.pde or any of the corresponding files to open the project in the Processing IDE.\
Once opened, running the program and following all prompts properly will allow for the best overall functionality of the program. Each section has directions that should be read carefully and needed to be adhered to in order for both the Maze Solvers and Builder to run.
